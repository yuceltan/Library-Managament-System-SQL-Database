# Library Managament System SQL Database
 
Project Overview 

Our databases lecture final project is designed about the Library SQL system. 
According to technical researches, in every 10 libraries, 5 libraries do not have a 
database for their sources. The purpose of this project is when library 
management wants to design their books in a computer system, our Library SQL 
system can organize all books with a lot of categories. Libraries can find and 
upload their book with 9 different table mechanisms. In order of these tables; 
“Books”,”Authors”,”Customers”,”Debt”,”Library”,”Publisher”,”Staff”,”Students”,”
Transaction”.
All these tables were inserted into our database. It means you can find all code 
documents in our project, also I want to give information about our data. All book 
resources are taken from real authors, real customers, real books, and real 
transaction logs. Additionally, our project has 9 correct created tables without 
dummy data. Also, in the project file, we added query documents for support to 
the project. In “SQLQuery” file has all inserted data with their order and in second 
query file “library” has all tables, their check constraints codes. Also, on the next 
pages, you can see a detailed SQL diagram with other details. During the project, 
all progress is recorded by screenshots, Microsoft SQL Management Studio, and 
Microsoft Teams, all these reports are in the project files. In database system 
does not have just book SQL data outside of this feature, Library SQL system has 
student data, this data can help all transactions such as; debts, students’ classes, 
“who get this book?”, also all these tables associated with other tables in this way 
we can track customers, activities of staff, debt processes, and all these 
transactions. 
Our goal and purpose of these projects are reach to all libraries and categories all 
this information is in one base and when needed this information provides 
additional functionality for management to generate reports on service activity

Functionality

The database allows technicians to complete the following functions:
 Enter a new book or setting information about books in library,
 Enter a new students or customer into library,
 Modify an existing student or customer information.
 The database is really helpful for new staff. Easy to getting and setting 
information about whole library, etc authors and books. There is also transaction 
and debt info that allows the staff to watch and follow the processes

Database Design Process

 Our basic approach for the database project was to take an existing basic 
prototype and optimize the database design. Our goal was to develop it with 
Microsoft SQL. We began the project by doing some planning, design, and review 
of the existing prototype.
We discussed about the tables. What tables do we need and how many can we 
do. We created nine tables. Our table design provides future flexibility for growth 
and changes to the database tables. After creating tables, we created the columns 
and made it ready for designing diagram. By the next step we did task distribution 
between three of us and insert data for the tables.
 We learned several important lessons through the design process. Designing our 
tables is the most important step and must be done early in the project. The project 
was a learning experience for three of us and allowed us to improve upon our SQL 
skills
